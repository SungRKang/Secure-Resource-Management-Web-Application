**Project Title: Secure Resource Management Web Application**

**Project Overview:**
Develop a web application that serves as a secure portal for managing a set of resources (e.g., virtual machines, IoT devices, or cloud services). The application will provide users with the ability to view, create, update, and delete resources, requiring custom token authentication for access control. This project will offer hands-on experience with full-stack development, focusing on modern web technologies, cloud services, and advanced authentication mechanisms.

**Objectives:**

1. **Frontend Development:**
   - Implement a responsive, user-friendly interface using TypeScript and React.
   - Utilize a modern UI component library for React to design the application, ensuring a professional look and feel.
   - Develop a dynamic frontend that interacts with the backend using AJAX calls, handling data display and real-time updates efficiently.
   - Incorporate advanced frontend features, such as modals for detailed resource management and search functionality with filters.

2. **Backend Development:**
   - Create a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda functions for handling business logic related to resource management operations (CRUD).
   - Use API Gateway to expose the Lambda functions as HTTP endpoints, enabling communication with the frontend.
   - Integrate DynamoDB for storing resource data, designing an effective schema for fast queries and updates.
   - Implement custom logging and monitoring solutions to track usage and errors, facilitating easier debugging and optimization.

3. **Custom Token Authentication:**
   - Design and implement a secure token-based authentication system to control access to the web application.
   - Ensure the authentication flow includes token generation, validation, and expiration handling without relying on standard OAuth libraries.
   - Utilize cookies securely for storing session information, implementing mechanisms to prevent CSRF and XSS attacks.
   - Explore the use of AWS KMS for encrypting sensitive authentication tokens and credentials, enhancing security.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Gain deep understanding and practical experience with React, TypeScript, and advanced state management techniques in frontend development.
- Acquire skills in serverless architecture design, specifically using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, for scalable and efficient backend solutions.
- Master the principles and implementation of custom token-based authentication systems, including secure token handling and session management.
- Develop proficiency in integrating and securing AWS cloud services, emphasizing security best practices and data encryption with AWS KMS.
- Enhance problem-solving abilities by addressing complex challenges related to frontend-backend integration, authentication flows, and data security.

**Milestone Plan:**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Environment setup, initial frontend mockup, and basic React application structure.
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Frontend development with static data, incorporating UI components and layout.
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Backend setup with AWS Lambda and API Gateway, basic CRUD operations without authentication.
4. **Weeks 7-8:** Implement custom token authentication and secure communication between frontend and backend.
5. **Weeks 9-10:** Finalize frontend-backend integration, conduct extensive testing, and start user acceptance testing.
6. **Weeks 11-12:** Refinement based on feedback, deployment optimizations, and documentation.
